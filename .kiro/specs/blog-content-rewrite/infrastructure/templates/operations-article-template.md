## Introduction (150-250 words)

### Hook Options:
- **Efficiency Statistic**: "Hotels that optimize [operation] reduce costs by [X]% while improving [metric]."
- **Challenge**: "The average hotel spends [X]% of revenue on [operation], yet [Y]% report inefficiencies."
- **Question**: "Is your [operation] a profit center or a cost drain?"
- **Benchmark**: "Top-performing hotels achieve [metric] of [X], while the average is only [Y]."

### Structure:
1. **Opening Hook** (1-2 sentences)
   - Operational challenge or opportunity
   - Specific to the article's operational focus

2. **Context & Relevance** (2-3 sentences)
   - Current operational landscape
   - Why this operation matters
   - Impact on profitability or guest satisfaction

3. **Preview** (1-2 sentences)
   - What operational strategies the article covers
   - Expected improvements or outcomes

### Example:
```markdown
Housekeeping typically represents 15-20% of a hotel's total operating costs, yet it's often treated as a necessary expense rather than a strategic profit driver. Properties that optimize housekeeping operations can reduce costs by 10-15% while simultaneously improving guest satisfaction scores and room turnover times.

The difference between efficient and inefficient housekeeping operations extends beyond labor costs. It impacts room availability, revenue management flexibility, guest experience, and staff retention. Yet many hotels still rely on outdated scheduling methods, inconsistent quality standards, and manual processes that waste time and resources.

This guide explores proven strategies to optimize housekeeping efficiency, including labor scheduling techniques, technology solutions, quality control systems, and performance metrics that drive continuous improvement.
