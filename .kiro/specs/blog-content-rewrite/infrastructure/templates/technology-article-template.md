## Introduction (150-250 words)

### Hook Options:
- **ROI Statistic**: "Hotels that implement [technology] see [X]% improvement in [metric] within [timeframe]."
- **Challenge**: "The average hotel uses [X] disconnected systems, creating inefficiency and data silos."
- **Question**: "Is your technology stack driving efficiency or creating complexity?"
- **Trend**: "AI-powered [technology] has transformed how hotels approach [operation]."

### Structure:
1. **Opening Hook** (1-2 sentences)
   - Technology impact or challenge
   - Specific to the article's technology focus

2. **Context & Relevance** (2-3 sentences)
   - Current state of technology adoption
   - Why this technology matters now
   - Industry trends or shifts

3. **Preview** (1-2 sentences)
   - What technology solutions the article covers
   - Expected benefits or outcomes

### Example:
```markdown
Hotels invest an average of 3-5% of revenue in technology, yet many struggle to demonstrate clear ROI. The difference between technology that drives efficiency and technology that creates complexity often comes down to strategic implementation and integration planning.

Digital transformation in hospitality has accelerated dramatically, with AI, cloud-based systems, and mobile solutions becoming standard rather than innovative. However, the rush to adopt new technology has left many properties with fragmented systems that don't communicate effectively, resulting in duplicate data entry, inconsistent guest information, and operational inefficiencies.

This guide examines how to evaluate, implement, and optimize hotel technology for maximum impact, focusing on practical ROI considerations and integration strategies that ensure technology investments deliver measurable value.
