## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Identify Primary Keyword (5 minutes)

The primary keyword is typically derived from the article title.

**Process**:
1. Extract main concept from article title
2. Simplify to 2-4 word phrase
3. Verify it matches search intent
4. Check if it's commonly searched

**Example**:
- **Article Title**: "Maximizing RevPAR: Strategies Beyond Room Rates"
- **Primary Keyword Options**:
  - "RevPAR strategies" ✅ (specific, searchable)
  - "maximize RevPAR" ✅ (action-oriented)
  - "revenue per available room" ✅ (full term)
  - "hotel revenue" ❌ (too broad)
- **Selected**: "RevPAR strategies"

**Validation**:
- Google the keyword - do results match our article topic?
- Is it specific enough to rank for?
- Does it have commercial intent (for our B2B audience)?

### Step 2: Find Secondary Keywords (5-7 minutes)

Secondary keywords support the primary keyword and cover related concepts.

**Process**:
1. **Google Search Suggestions**:
   - Type primary keyword in Google
   - Note autocomplete suggestions
   - Scroll to "People also ask"
   - Check "Related searches" at bottom

2. **Identify 3-5 Related Terms**:
   - Variations of primary keyword
   - Related concepts from article outline
   - Industry-specific terminology
   - Problem/solution phrases

**Example for "RevPAR strategies"**:
- "revenue per available room" (variation)
- "hotel pricing strategies" (related concept)
- "yield management" (industry term)
- "optimize hotel revenue" (action phrase)
- "RevPAR optimization" (variation)

**Selection Criteria**:
- Relevant to article content
- Natural to integrate
- Adds semantic richness
- Covers different search intents

### Step 3: Discover Long-Tail Keywords (3-5 minutes)

Long-tail keywords are longer, more specific phrases with lower competition.

**Process**:
1. **Question-Based**:
   - "how to increase RevPAR"
   - "what is RevPAR in hotels"
   - "how to calculate RevPAR"

2. **Specific Scenarios**:
   - "RevPAR strategies for luxury hotels"
   - "RevPAR optimization techniques"
   - "improving RevPAR without raising rates"

3. **Location-Based** (when relevant):
   - "RevPAR strategies Southeast Asia"
   - "hotel revenue management Asia"

**Sources**:
- Google autocomplete
- "People also ask" section
- Related searches
- Competitor article headings

**Target**: 3-5 long-tail variations

### Step 4: Analyze Search Intent (2-3 minutes)

Understanding what searchers want helps shape content.

**Intent Types**:

1. **Informational**: Learning about a topic
   - "what is RevPAR"
   - "RevPAR definition"
   - "how RevPAR works"

2. **Commercial**: Researching solutions
   - "best RevPAR strategies"
   - "RevPAR optimization tools"
   - "RevPAR management software"

3. **Transactional**: Ready to take action

   - "RevPAR consulting services"
   - "book revenue management course"

4. **Navigational**: Looking for specific resource
   - "A&A Hospitality RevPAR guide"
   - "STR RevPAR report"

**For Our Articles**:
- Primary intent: **Informational** (educating professionals)
- Secondary intent: **Commercial** (positioning our services)

**Content Implications**:
- Informational: Provide comprehensive guides, how-tos, explanations
- Commercial: Include tool recommendations, service mentions, CTAs

### Step 5: Assess Competition (2-3 minutes)

Quick competitive analysis to understand ranking difficulty.

**Process**:
1. Google primary keyword
2. Analyze top 5 results:
   - What type of content ranks? (guides, tools, definitions)
   - Who ranks? (competitors, industry sites, publications)
   - Content depth? (word count, comprehensiveness)
   - Content quality? (specific vs. generic)

**Competition Levels**:
- **Low**: Few quality results, generic content, opportunity to rank
- **Medium**: Some quality content, established sites, need strong content
- **High**: Major sites, comprehensive content, difficult to rank

**Strategy by Competition**:
- **Low**: Target directly, optimize well
- **Medium**: Create superior content, focus on unique angle
- **High**: Target long-tail variations, focus on specific niche

**Example Analysis**:
```
Keyword: "RevPAR strategies"
Top Results:
1. Industry publication - comprehensive guide (2000 words)
2. Hotel tech vendor - product-focused
3. Consulting firm - generic overview
4. Academic article - theoretical
