3. Link to complementary articles in different categories
4. Use descriptive anchor text that includes keywords

**Suggested Internal Linking Strategy:**

**Revenue Articles** should link to:
- Other revenue articles (pricing, RevPAR, direct bookings)
- Technology articles (revenue management systems)
- Operations articles (F&B profitability)

**Operations Articles** should link to:
- Other operations articles
- Technology articles (operational systems)
- HR articles (staff management)

**Technology Articles** should link to:
- Operations articles (implementation)
- Revenue articles (revenue tech)
- Trends articles (future technology)

**Trends Articles** should link to:

1. direct-booking-strategies-reducing-ota-dependency.md
2. crisis-management-for-hospitality-leaders.md
3. security-and-privacy-in-the-modern-hotel.md
4. asset-management-vs-property-management-what-owners-need-to-know.md
5. the-role-of-branding-in-hotel-asset-valuation.md

**Missing Opportunities:**
- 20 articles lack clear featured snippet optimization
- Few articles use question-format headings
- Limited use of numbered lists and step-by-step guides

**Recommendations:**
1. Add question-format H2 headings (What is, How to, Why, etc.)
2. Include numbered lists for processes and strategies
3. Provide clear, concise definitions (40-60 words)
4. Structure "how-to" content with numbered steps
5. Create comparison tables where appropriate

**Example Question Headings to Add:**
- "What is RevPAR and Why Does It Matter?"
- "How to Calculate Revenue Management ROI"
- "Why Direct Bookings Reduce Costs"
- "What Are the Key Components of Hotel Asset Management?"
- "How to Implement Dynamic Pricing Strategies"
