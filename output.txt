# Design Document

## Overview

This design implements comprehensive social media sharing metadata and Progressive Web App (PWA) visual metadata for the A&A Hospitality Solutions Next.js application. The solution leverages Next.js 16's built-in Metadata API to configure Open Graph tags, Twitter Cards, and PWA-specific metadata. Additionally, it includes a web app manifest file and optimized icon generation from existing logo assets.

The implementation will enhance the application's social media presence by ensuring rich preview cards appear when links are shared, and improve the mobile experience by providing proper PWA configuration with branded icons and theme colors.

## Architecture

The metadata system follows Next.js App Router conventions with a hierarchical structure:

1. **Application-Level Metadata** (layout.tsx): Defines default metadata for the entire application
2. **Page-Level Metadata** (page.tsx): Overrides or extends application metadata for specific routes
3. **Static Assets**: Web app manifest, icons, and social share images stored in the public directory
4. **Icon Generation Pipeline**: Scripts or manual process to generate optimized icons from SVG logos

### Component Hierarchy

```
app/
├── layout.tsx (Application metadata + manifest link)
├── page.tsx (Home page metadata)
├── services/
│   └── page.tsx (Services page metadata)
├── privacy-policy/
│   └── page.tsx (Privacy page metadata)
└── terms-of-service/
    └── page.tsx (Terms page metadata)

public/
├── manifest.json (PWA manifest)
├── og-image.png (Default Open Graph image 1200x630)
├── icons/
│   ├── icon-192.png (PWA icon 192x192)
│   ├── icon-512.png (PWA icon 512x512)
│   └── apple-touch-icon.png (iOS home screen icon 180x180)
```

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Metadata Configuration (TypeScript)

The metadata will be defined using Next.js Metadata API types:

```typescript
import type { Metadata } from "next";

interface SocialMetadata {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  image: string;
  url: string;
}

// Application-level metadata factory
function createMetadata(config: SocialMetadata): Metadata {
  return {
    title: config.title,
    description: config.description,
    keywords: ["hospitality", "solutions", "A&A", "business"],
    authors: [{ name: "A&A Hospitality Solutions" }],
    openGraph: {
      title: config.title,
      description: config.description,
      type: "website",
      url: config.url,
      images: [
        {
          url: config.image,
          width: 1200,
          height: 630,
          alt: config.title,
        },
      ],
      siteName: "A&A Hospitality Solutions",
    },
    twitter: {
      card: "summary_large_image",
      title: config.title,
      description: config.description,
      images: [config.image],
    },
    appleWebApp: {
      capable: true,
      statusBarStyle: "black-translucent",
      title: config.title,
    },
    manifest: "/manifest.json",
  };
}
```

### 2. Web App Manifest Structure

```typescript
interface WebAppManifest {
  name: string;
  short_name: string;
  description: string;
  start_url: string;
  display: "standalone" | "fullscreen" | "minimal-ui" | "browser";
  background_color: string;
  theme_color: string;
  icons: Array<{
    src: string;
    sizes: string;
    type: string;
    purpose?: string;
  }>;
}
```

### 3. Icon Generation Interface

```typescript
interface IconGenerationConfig {
  sourceSvg: string; // Path to source SVG
  outputPath: string; // Directory for generated icons
  sizes: number[]; // Array of sizes to generate
  backgroundColor?: string; // Optional background color
  padding?: number; // Padding around logo
}
```

## Data Models

### Metadata Model

```typescript
type PageMetadata = {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  ogImage?: string; // Optional custom OG image
  keywords?: string[];
  canonical?: string; // Canonical URL
};

// Default metadata for the application
const DEFAULT_METADATA: PageMetadata = {
  title: "A&A Hospitality Solutions",
  description:
    "Experience elegant animations and modern design solutions for your hospitality business",
  ogImage: "https://anahospitality.com/og-image.png",
  keywords: ["hospitality", "solutions", "business", "A&A"],
};
```

### Manifest Model

```typescript
const MANIFEST_CONFIG: WebAppManifest = {
  name: "A&A Hospitality Solutions",
  short_name: "A&A",
  description: "Hospitality solutions for modern businesses",
  start_url: "/",
  display: "standalone",
  background_color: "#F5EFE6",
  theme_color: "#28536b",
  icons: [
    {
      src: "/icons/icon-192.png",
      sizes: "192x192",
      type: "image/png",
      purpose: "any maskable",
    },
    {
      src: "/icons/icon-512.png",
      sizes: "512x512",
      type: "image/png",
      purpose: "any maskable",
    },
  ],
};
```

## Correctness Properties

*A property is a characteristic or behavior that should hold true across all valid executions of a system-essentially, a formal statement about what the system should do. Properties serve as the bridge between human-readable specifications and machine-verifiable correctness guarantees.*

### Property 1: Metadata completeness for social platforms

*For any* page in the application, when metadata is rendered, all required Open Graph properties (og:title, og:description, og:image, og:url, og:type) and Twitter Card properties (twitter:card, twitter:title, twitter:description, twitter:image) should be present in the HTML head.

**Validates: Requirements 1.3, 1.4**

### Property 2: Absolute URL consistency

*For any* metadata image URL (OG image, Twitter image, or icon), the URL should be absolute (starting with http:// or https://) and include the full domain, not a relative path.

**Validates: Requirements 1.5**

### Property 3: Manifest icon size completeness

*For any* PWA manifest configuration, the icons array should include at least one icon with size 192x192px and at least one icon with size 512x512px.

**Validates: Requirements 2.4**

### Property 4: Theme color consistency

*For any* page in the application, the theme-color meta tag value should match the brand's primary color (#28536b) and be consistent with the viewport themeColor configuration.

**Validates: Requirements 3.1, 3.5**

### Property 5: Metadata inheritance and override

*For any* page with custom metadata, when merged with application-level metadata, the page-specific values should take precedence over application defaults, and all required fields should remain populated.

**Validates: Requirements 5.1, 5.2, 5.4**

### Property 6: Manifest JSON validity

*For any* web app manifest file, when parsed as JSON, it should be valid JSON without syntax errors and conform to the Web App Manifest specification schema.

**Validates: Requirements 6.3**

### Property 7: Icon dimension accuracy

*For any* generated icon file, the actual pixel dimensions should match the declared size in the manifest or meta tag (e.g., a file declared as 192x192 should actually be 192x192 pixels).

**Validates: Requirements 4.3**

### Property 8: OG image dimension compliance

*For any* social share image used as an OG image, the dimensions should be 1200x630 pixels to ensure optimal display across all social platforms.

**Validates: Requirements 4.1**

## Error Handling

### Missing Environment Variables

- **Issue**: Base URL not configured for absolute URLs
- **Solution**: Provide fallback to relative URLs in development, require NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL in production
- **Implementation**: Use environment variable with validation in metadata generation

### Invalid Manifest JSON

- **Issue**: Syntax errors in manifest.json
- **Solution**: Validate manifest during build process, provide clear error messages
- **Implementation**: Add JSON schema validation in build script

### Missing Icon Files

- **Issue**: Referenced icons don't exist in public directory
- **Solution**: Validate icon paths during build, provide fallback icons
- **Implementation**: Check file existence in build script, log warnings for missing assets

### Image Generation Failures

- **Issue**: SVG to PNG conversion fails
- **Solution**: Provide manual fallback instructions, validate generated images
- **Implementation**: Try-catch around image generation, verify output dimensions

### Metadata Merge Conflicts

- **Issue**: Page metadata conflicts with application metadata
- **Solution**: Follow Next.js precedence rules, document merge behavior
- **Implementation**: Use Next.js built-in metadata merging, test edge cases

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

Unit tests will verify:

1. **Metadata Factory Functions**: Test that createMetadata() generates correct structure
2. **URL Formatting**: Test absolute URL generation from relative paths
3. **Metadata Merging**: Test that page metadata correctly overrides app metadata
4. **Manifest Generation**: Test that manifest object matches schema

Example test cases:
- Given a relative image path, when converted to absolute URL, should include domain
- Given page metadata with custom title, when merged with app metadata, should use custom title
- Given manifest config, when serialized to JSON, should be valid JSON

### Property-Based Testing

Property-based tests will use fast-check library to verify:

1. **Metadata Completeness Property**: Generate random page configs, verify all required fields present
2. **URL Absoluteness Property**: Generate random image paths, verify all become absolute URLs
3. **Icon Size Property**: Generate random manifest configs, verify required icon sizes present
4. **Theme Color Consistency Property**: Generate random page metadata, verify theme color matches brand color

### Integration Testing

Integration tests will verify:

1. **HTML Output**: Render pages and verify meta tags in HTML head
2. **Manifest Accessibility**: Verify /manifest.json is accessible and valid
3. **Icon Accessibility**: Verify all referenced icon files exist and are accessible
4. **Social Platform Validation**: Use external validators (Facebook Debugger, Twitter Card Validator)

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. Share link on WhatsApp - verify preview card appears
2. Share link on X/Twitter - verify Twitter Card appears
3. Share link on LinkedIn - verify preview card appears
4. Add to iOS home screen - verify icon and splash screen
5. Add to Android home screen - verify icon
6. Check status bar color on iOS Safari
7. Check status bar color on Android Chrome
8. Validate with Facebook Sharing Debugger
9. Validate with Twitter Card Validator
10. Validate manifest with Chrome DevTools

### Testing Tools

- **fast-check**: Property-based testing library for TypeScript
- **@testing-library/react**: Component testing
- **vitest**: Test runner (already in project)
- **Facebook Sharing Debugger**: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/
- **Twitter Card Validator**: https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator
- **Chrome DevTools**: Application tab for PWA manifest inspection

### Test Coverage Goals

- Unit tests: 100% coverage of metadata utility functions
- Property tests: All 8 correctness properties implemented
- Integration tests: All critical user paths (sharing, PWA installation)
- Manual validation: All social platforms and mobile devices tested before release

# Icon Generation Scripts

This directory contains scripts for generating optimized icon assets for social sharing and PWA functionality.

## Generated Assets

The scripts generate the following assets:

### PWA Icons
- `public/icons/icon-192.png` - 192x192px PWA icon (white logo on #28536b background)
- `public/icons/icon-512.png` - 512x512px PWA icon (white logo on #28536b background)
- `public/icons/apple-touch-icon.png` - 180x180px Apple touch icon (white logo on #28536b background)

### Social Sharing
- `public/og-image.png` - 1200x630px Open Graph image (blue logo on #F5EFE6 background)

## Usage

### Generate Icons

To generate all icon assets from the source logo:

```bash
npm run generate-icons
```

This will:
1. Create the `public/icons/` directory if it doesn't exist
2. Generate all PWA icons with proper dimensions and branding
3. Generate the Open Graph social sharing image

### Verify Icons

To verify that all icons have the correct dimensions:

```bash
npm run verify-icons
```

This will check that:
- icon-192.png is 192x192px
- icon-512.png is 512x512px
- apple-touch-icon.png is 180x180px
- og-image.png is 1200x630px

## Source Assets

The scripts use `public/logo-square.svg` as the source logo file.

## Brand Colors

- Primary Blue: `#28536b` (used for icon backgrounds)
- Beige: `#F5EFE6` (used for OG image background)
- White: `#ffffff` (used for logo color on icons)

## Requirements

The scripts require the following dependencies:
- `sharp` - Image processing library
- `tsx` - TypeScript execution

These are installed as dev dependencies and should be available after running `npm install`.

## Customization

To customize the generated icons:

1. Edit `scripts/generate-icons.ts`
2. Modify the padding, colors, or sizes as needed
3. Run `npm run generate-icons` to regenerate
4. Run `npm run verify-icons` to verify the output

## Notes

- Icons are optimized for web delivery with PNG format
- The white logo version is automatically created by replacing the black (#231f20) color
- Padding is applied to ensure the logo doesn't touch the edges
- All icons use transparent backgrounds where appropriate

# ${article.title}

In the rapidly evolving landscape of global hospitality, **${article.title}** stands out as a pivotal subject for owners and asset managers alike. As we navigate the complexities of the current market, understanding the nuances of this topic is no longer optional—it is essential for sustainable growth.

## The Current Landscape

For years, the industry has grappled with shifting paradigms. Today, we observe a distinct trend towards more integrated approaches. Whether it is through operational efficiency or strategic capital expenditure, the goal remains the same: **maximizing asset value**.

> "The true measure of success in hospitality is not just occupancy, but the long-term health and relevance of the asset."

### Key Challenges

1.  **Market Volatility**: Fluctuating demand patterns require agile management strategies.
2.  **Cost Pressures**: Rising operational costs demand smarter resource allocation.
3.  **Guest Expectations**: The modern traveler demands hyper-personalization and seamless experiences.

## Strategic Approaches to ${article.category}

To address these challenges, we recommend a multi-faceted approach.

### 1. Data-Driven Decision Making

Leveraging data analytics allows for more precise forecasting and personalized guest targeting. By moving away from intuition-based decisions, owners can mitigate risk and uncover hidden revenue streams.

### 2. Operational Agility

Flexibility in operations is key. This means cross-training staff, adopting scalable technology stacks, and ensuring that standard operating procedures (SOPs) are living documents that evolve with the market.

### 3. Sustainable Practices

Sustainability is more than a buzzword; it is a business imperative. Implementing energy-efficient systems and waste reduction programs not only lowers utility costs but also appeals to the eco-conscious demographic.

## Looking Ahead

As we look towards the future, the importance of **${article.title}** will only grow. Those who proactively address these issues today will find themselves well-positioned to lead the market tomorrow.

At ANA Hospitality, we are committed to guiding our partners through these complex terrains. Our expertise in ${article.category} ensures that your asset is not just surviving, but thriving.

# Contact Section & Footer

Comprehensive contact section and footer components for A&A Hospitality, styled to match the brand identity.

## Contact Section

A two-column layout featuring contact information and a contact form.

### Features

- **Contact Information Card**:
  - Location with address
  - Phone number with click-to-call
  - WhatsApp link with pre-filled message
  - Email with mailto link
  - Icons using lucide-react

- **Contact Form Card**:
  - Name, Email, Phone, Subject, Message fields
  - Form validation
  - Loading states
  - Success/error messages
  - Accessible form labels

### Customization

#### Update Contact Information

Edit `src/components/ContactSection.tsx`:

```tsx
// Address
<p className={styles.infoText}>
  123 Hospitality Lane<br />
  Suite 100<br />
  City, State 12345
</p>

// Phone
<a href="tel:+1234567890" className={styles.infoLink}>
  +1 (234) 567-890
</a>

// WhatsApp
<a
  href="https://wa.me/1234567890?text=Hello!%20I%27m%20interested%20in%20your%20hospitality%20services"
  ...
>

// Email
<a href="mailto:hello@aahospitalitysolutions.com" className={styles.infoLink}>
  hello@aahospitalitysolutions.com
</a>
```

#### Form API Endpoint

The form submits to `/api/contact`. You'll need to create this API route:

```tsx
// src/app/api/contact/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const data = await request.json();
  
  // Process form data (send email, save to database, etc.)
  
  return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
}
```

## Footer

A comprehensive footer with branding, navigation links, and social media.

### Features

- **Brand Column**:
  - Logo
  - Company description
  - Social media links (LinkedIn, Instagram)

- **Link Columns**:
  - Services
  - Company
  - Resources

- **Bottom Section**:
  - Copyright notice
  - Legal links (Privacy, Terms)
  - Contact link

### Customization

#### Update Footer Links

Edit `src/components/Footer.tsx`:

```tsx
const footerColumns: FooterColumn[] = [
  {
    title: "Services",
    links: [
      { title: "Your Service", href: "/services/your-service" },
      // Add more links
    ],
  },
  // Add more columns
];
```

#### Update Social Links

```tsx
<Link
  href="https://linkedin.com/company/yourcompany"
  ...
>
```

#### Update Logo

Replace the logo path in Footer.tsx:

```tsx
<Image
  src="/your-logo.svg"
  alt="Your Company"
  width={192}
  height={48}
/>
```

## Brand Colors Used

- **Charcoal Blue** (#28536b): Primary text, footer background, buttons
- **Rosy Taupe** (#c2948a): Accents, error states
- **Steel Blue** (#7ea8be): Links, icons, hover states
- **Parchment** (#f6f0ed): Background, light text
- **Khaki Beige** (#bbb193): Secondary accents

## Responsive Design

Both components are fully responsive:

- **Desktop**: Two-column layout
- **Tablet**: Adjusted spacing and sizing
- **Mobile**: Single-column stacked layout

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML
- ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation
- Focus states
- Reduced motion support
- Form validation
- Screen reader friendly

## Integration

Both components are already added to the main page (`src/app/page.tsx`):

```tsx
<main>
  <Landing />
  <ContactSection />
</main>
<Footer />
```

The Contact Section appears before the Footer at the bottom of the page.

# Floating Contact Icons

A fixed-position contact widget with phone and WhatsApp buttons, styled to match the A&A Hospitality brand.

## Features

- **Phone Button**: Direct call functionality with charcoal-blue hover effect
- **WhatsApp Button**: Opens WhatsApp chat with steel-blue hover effect
- **Tooltips**: Hover tooltips showing action descriptions
- **Responsive**: Adapts to mobile screens
- **Accessible**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
- **Brand Colors**: Uses A&A Hospitality color palette (charcoal-blue, rosy-taupe, steel-blue, parchment)

## Customization

### Update Phone Number

Edit the `href` attribute in `FloatingContactIcons.tsx`:

```tsx
href="tel:+1234567890"  // Replace with your phone number
```

### Update WhatsApp Number and Message

Edit the WhatsApp link:

```tsx
href="https://wa.me/1234567890?text=Hello!%20I%27m%20interested%20in%20your%20hospitality%20services"
```

Replace:
- `1234567890` with your WhatsApp number (include country code, no + or spaces)
- The text after `text=` with your custom pre-filled message (URL encoded)

### Styling

The component uses CSS modules (`FloatingContactIcons.module.css`) with brand colors:

- **Phone Button**: 
  - Border: rosy-taupe
  - Hover background: charcoal-blue
  - Icon: charcoal-blue → parchment on hover

- **WhatsApp Button**:
  - Border: steel-blue
  - Hover background: steel-blue
  - Icon: steel-blue → parchment on hover

### Position

Default position is bottom-right (24px from edges). To change:

Edit in `FloatingContactIcons.module.css`:

```css
.container {
  bottom: var(--space-6);  /* 24px */
  right: var(--space-6);   /* 24px */
}
```

## Analytics Integration

To track clicks, you can add event handlers:

```tsx
onClick={() => {
  // Your analytics code here
  console.log('Phone button clicked');
}}
```

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

# Asset Management vs. Property Management: What Owners Need to Know

In the rapidly evolving landscape of global hospitality, **Asset Management vs. Property Management: What Owners Need to Know** stands out as a pivotal subject for owners and asset managers alike. As we navigate the complexities of the current market, understanding the nuances of this topic is no longer optional—it is essential for sustainable growth.

## The Current Landscape

For years, the industry has grappled with shifting paradigms. Today, we observe a distinct trend towards more integrated approaches. Whether it is through operational efficiency or strategic capital expenditure, the goal remains the same: **maximizing asset value**.

> "The true measure of success in hospitality is not just occupancy, but the long-term health and relevance of the asset."

### Key Challenges

1.  **Market Volatility**: Fluctuating demand patterns require agile management strategies.
2.  **Cost Pressures**: Rising operational costs demand smarter resource allocation.
3.  **Guest Expectations**: The modern traveler demands hyper-personalization and seamless experiences.

## Strategic Approaches to Asset Management

To address these challenges, we recommend a multi-faceted approach.

### 1. Data-Driven Decision Making

Leveraging data analytics allows for more precise forecasting and personalized guest targeting. By moving away from intuition-based decisions, owners can mitigate risk and uncover hidden revenue streams.

### 2. Operational Agility

Flexibility in operations is key. This means cross-training staff, adopting scalable technology stacks, and ensuring that standard operating procedures (SOPs) are living documents that evolve with the market.

### 3. Sustainable Practices

Sustainability is more than a buzzword; it is a business imperative. Implementing energy-efficient systems and waste reduction programs not only lowers utility costs but also appeals to the eco-conscious demographic.

## Looking Ahead

As we look towards the future, the importance of **Asset Management vs. Property Management: What Owners Need to Know** will only grow. Those who proactively address these issues today will find themselves well-positioned to lead the market tomorrow.

For years, the industry has grappled with shifting paradigms. Today, we observe a distinct trend towards more integrated approaches. Whether it is through operational efficiency or strategic capital expenditure, the goal remains the same: **maximizing asset value**.

> "The true measure of success in hospitality is not just occupancy, but the long-term health and relevance of the asset."

### Key Challenges

1.  **Market Volatility**: Fluctuating demand patterns require agile management strategies.
2.  **Cost Pressures**: Rising operational costs demand smarter resource allocation.
3.  **Guest Expectations**: The modern traveler demands hyper-personalization and seamless experiences.

## Strategic Approaches to Trends

To address these challenges, we recommend a multi-faceted approach.

### 1. Data-Driven Decision Making

Leveraging data analytics allows for more precise forecasting and personalized guest targeting. By moving away from intuition-based decisions, owners can mitigate risk and uncover hidden revenue streams.

### 2. Operational Agility

Flexibility in operations is key. This means cross-training staff, adopting scalable technology stacks, and ensuring that standard operating procedures (SOPs) are living documents that evolve with the market.

### 3. Sustainable Practices

Sustainability is more than a buzzword; it is a business imperative. Implementing energy-efficient systems and waste reduction programs not only lowers utility costs but also appeals to the eco-conscious demographic.

## Looking Ahead

As we look towards the future, the importance of **Wellness Tourism: Integrating Health into Hospitality** will only grow. Those who proactively address these issues today will find themselves well-positioned to lead the market tomorrow.

At A&A Hospitality, we are committed to guiding our partners through these complex terrains. Our expertise in Trends ensures that your asset is not just surviving, but thriving.
